        <p>Hi I am Kevin and I am currently undertaking a Software Development course. So far it has been a plesant journey that has required me to step up in the choices I make with my time and resources. I have opted to invest in myself with the goal of a better future based on the sacrifices I make today. I was fortunate to enrol in Moringa School where I get to interact with eager students and teachers who would stop to assist when you are facing a wall, that's hard to come by. I look forward to adding the skills gained from this institution to my everyday life as I look for the passion someone ought to have in life.</p>
